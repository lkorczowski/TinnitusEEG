# Git merge branch into master (or other)

1. (better than the option below). USE PULL REQUEST FROM GITHUB AND ASK A CODE REVIEW (assign someone)

OR (only for small changes that doesn't require a pull request and code review)

1. `git checkout master`(this is the output folder)
2. `git merge feature_branch_name -m "merge description"`(will merge the feature_branch into master)
3. (optional) If you don't need the feature_branch anymore, you can delete it:
   `git branch -d feature_branch_name`
4. `git push` to push the merge to the remote
5.  (optional if 3 done) `git push origin -d feature_branch_name`
